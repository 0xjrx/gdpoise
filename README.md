## Tired of GDB Debugging Your ELF Binaries? Meet **gdpoise**! üõ°Ô∏è

Ever wanted to modify an ELF binary‚Äôs header to prevent GDB from debugging it, while still keeping the binary functional? No? Well, now you can! Introducing **gdpoise** ‚Äî a simple tool to help you do exactly that.

### What does **gdpoise** do?

**gdpoise** modifies the ELF binary's header by overwriting key fields:  
- Section number  
- Section offset  
- String entries in the header table  

This effectively prevents GDB from debugging the binary by making it "unrecognizable" to the debugger, while maintaining the functionality of the binary itself. 

### A word of caution

While this tool is effective against GDB, it's worth noting that other debuggers sometimes use automated scripts to restore the corrupted binary, so this technique might not work in every case.

### Disclaimer

- **I am not liable** for any damage or unintended consequences resulting from the use of this tool.
- **No guarantees** of flawless functionality!

### Inspiration and Ressources

I first read about this technique in a Paper by Brian Roden from the University of Arkansas, called "Linux Malware Obfuscation". Apparently,
this technique was also used by the Mirai botnet malware to prohibit ressearchers from analyzing binaries. Also thanks to my friend [PlexSheep](https://github.com/PlexSheep), who is working on a debugger, motivating me to try this out as I rarely do coding projects.
